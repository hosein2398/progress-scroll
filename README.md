This library helps you get nice navbar on your screen to tell user how much of an article has been read by them.



# Usage
Load the script on your page and then:
```JS
ProgressScroll({
    element: ".test",
    color: "black",
    height: "8px",
    beforeRun: function () {

    },
    onRuning: function () {

    },
    onCompelete: function () {


    }
});
This example was full-optioned one so saw all available option to call `ProgressScroll` .
